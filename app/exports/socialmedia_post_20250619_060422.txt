As I delved into the latest Executive Order on Restoring Gold Standard Science, I was struck by the emphasis on rebuilding trust in scientific research and its applications. Over the last 5 years, confidence in scientists acting in the best interests of the public has significantly declined, with a majority of researchers believing that science is facing a reproducibility crisis. ðŸš¨ This order aims to reverse this trend by promoting transparency, rigor, and impartiality in scientific inquiry.

One of the key takeaways for me is the importance of acknowledging and communicating uncertainty in scientific findings. The order requires agencies to transparently document uncertainties, including how they propagate throughout models used in analysis. This approach not only promotes more accurate science but also fosters a culture of openness and transparency.

I believe that this order has significant implications for our professional network, as it seeks to ensure that Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available. By restoring a gold standard for science, we can rebuild trust in government decisions and promote a more informed and effective approach to policy-making.
