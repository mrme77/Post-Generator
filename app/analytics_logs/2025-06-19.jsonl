This order aims to restore trust in science by ensuring that federally funded research is transparent, rigorous, and impactful. According to the order, a majority of researchers believe that science is facing a reproducibility crisis, with the falsification of data leading to high-profile retractions of federally funded research.\n\nWhat struck me is the acknowledgment that the Federal Government has contributed to the loss of trust in science. The order cites examples of agencies using or promoting scientific information in a highly misleading manner, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 guidance on reopening schools. I think it's crucial that we learn from these mistakes and work towards a more transparent and objective approach to scientific decision-making.\n\nThe order establishes a \"Gold Standard\" for science, which includes reproducibility, transparency, and unbiased peer review. It also requires agencies to update their scientific integrity policies and to provide guidance on the implementation of Gold Standard Science. I believe that this initiative has the potential to restore faith in the scientific enterprise and ensure that government decisions are informed by the most credible and reliable scientific evidence.\n\nBased on work by the President, [May 23, 2025] #llm #science #integrity"}
